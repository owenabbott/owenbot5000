Okay! I don't know why there are two readmes. I also don't know why create react app isn't working anymore. It's time to think of some interview questions and possibly some interview answers.

Question the first: explain this gap in your job history. How do I write about this? How do I justify blowing 20k that I do not have and never will have on an education I could have gotten for free if I had just studied codeacademy for exactly one week? I don't know. Perhaps I should leave this question out.
