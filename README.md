Okay! I don't know why there are two readmes. I also don't know why create react app isn't working anymore. It's time to think of some interview questions and possibly some interview answers.

Question the first: explain this gap in your job history. 
Answer: How do I write about this? How do I justify blowing 20k that I do not have and never will have on an education I could have gotten for free if I had just studied codeacademy for exactly one week? I don't know. Perhaps I should leave this question out.

Question the second: Tell me about a time you overcame adversity.
Answer: Well, I guess I have more experience with this one. Though, to be honest, most of the shit I've been through isn't stuff that I've overcome so much as stuff that I have to live with, from which there is no escape. Like this scammy bootcamp debt. I'm going to be homeless! And I barely know javascript. I wouldn't call that 'overcoming' anything. Fuck you, interviewer, and fuck all rich people, for thinking that things work out fine for those of us below. Because they don't.

Question the third: Describe the ideal work environment or culture that would maximise your productivity and happiness.
Answer: Jesus *christ,* dude.
